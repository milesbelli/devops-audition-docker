# Devops Audition Challenge 6

This is divided into parts.

* Part 1 was just setup and involved no code.

* The folder dockerpt2 contains all relevant code for part 2.

* The folder dockerpt3 contains all relevant code for part 3.

* The final part would require only one command entered after the container was launched. That command would look like:

`docker exec -i -t p3_mysql bash`

Where `p3_mysql` is the name of the MySQL container.
